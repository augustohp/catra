Abstract

    This document describes a file format for sharing a collection of remote
    addresses to media files which can be shared through a peer to peer network.
    It aims to standarize how remote files MUST be referenced so multimedia
    players are able to play, cache and prefetch its contents as a stream from
    peer to peer networks.

    This specification defines the file format referenced to as "M3UP", which is
    intended to be shared through a peer to peer (P2P) network avoiding
    considerable restrition by not requiring a central authority for its
    distribution.

1. Introduction

    A M3UP provides a simple way of sharing a collection of Uniform Resource
    Identifiers (URI) [RFC3986].

2. Overview

    A M3UP file is an ASCII encoded plain/text file where all its itens MUST be
    a valid Magnet Link [BEP9]. Limiting its contents to only the BitTorrent
    network aims to ease implementation and adoption rather than actually
    provide any functionality.

    Here is an example of a valid M3UP file:

    #EXTM3UP
    #EXT-X-SERIAL:1
    #EXT-X-BTIH:BB280972A8AAEBF3079E7AA67AA896930D67509D

    #EXTINF:334, Tesseract - Utopia
    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:BB280972A8AAEBF3079E7AA67AA896930D67509F \
        &x.file=05.%20Utopia.mp3

    #EXTINF:281,Animals as Leaders - Physical Education
    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:3C40A7025C8501C6A70556193722568550B44811 \
        &x.file=Albums%2F2014%20-%20The%20Joy%20of%20Motion%2F05%20-%20 \
        Physical%20Education.mp3

    Every link should point to a singe multimedia file, the only exception being
    another M3UP file.
